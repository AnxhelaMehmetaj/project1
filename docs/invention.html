                                "The Internet is the next big thing. Its on par with the wheel, fire, language, the printing press” begins
                                this documentary from the History Channel talking about how the Internet is just as important and revolutionary
                                as the wheel or the printing press. There is no doubt that the Internet has been a revolutionary invention, but how
                                did it begin? To begin with, we will start with computers since they are the objects needed to access the
                                Internet. During the Space war, the US government noticed how the Soviet Union was advancing quicker than them
                                to space. Due to the US government not wanting to fall behind in space exploration, President Eisenhower
                                created a Bureau at the Defense department called the Advance Research Projects Agency, mainly known
                                as ARPA. ARPA would take care of space exploration and computer science research. Soon NASA took over
                                and left computer research behind. In the earliest form of computers, computers could take up the space of
                                an entire room. There were also very few of these computers since they were expensive and costly to maintain. As time
                                went on, millions of dollars went into research of computers and networks. One notable form of network or communication
                                that came from this would be that no matter if a line of communication between two computers was cut, there would be vast
                                other options for the data to get from computer A to computer B. At some point many institutions were creating their own
                                computers that contained their own protocols and if anyone else wanted to connect to them they would have to follow
                                their same protocol. This wasn’t very efficient as now every computer had to be programmed the protocol of another
                                computer before connecting to it and wasn’t very scalable. The creation of the ARPAnet was the answer to this
                                problem, also known as the ARPA network. The ARPAnet connected all computers in its network to each other making
                                scalability possible. However, using the ARPAnet was very esoteric and not many people knew how to use it. A couple
                                years later, Tim Berners Lee, created the World Wide Web allowing regular people to connect to the ARPAnet. This was
                                when the Internet as we know it today took off.

                                <h1> Telephone Invention</h1>
                                <p>It was marked a revolutionary departure from the telephones system use to of the technology called
                                    circuit switching.When you make a telephone call, when you pick up a telephone number, the switching system
                                    that connects with you, with the other telephone actually creates a  circuit between the two machines connection.
                                    and that communication is dedicated to the conversation even if you are not saying anything, the communication path is there.
                                    The telephone system had an achilles heel and still does if the connection between telephones is lost. That weakness become a
                                    matter of National Security to the military in the early 60s when they fear the Soviet nuclear attack.
                                    Besides leveling american cities,the telephone system would be so damaged that the military would be unable to launch a counterattack.
                                    To assure that retaliation America needed an indestructible communication network.</p>

                                At MIT the graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock begin applying Queueing theory to date to transmission.
                                queue is a very simple structure. It's simply a system to you which arrives hanging around while and then leave.
                                Like letters going through of posts' offices, kleinrock shows how packages of data would queue or line up at the communication
                                network as they transited through.This way he could determine the overall speed of the network.
                                He then showed how to speed up the internet by implementing the two techniques: demand access and distributed control.
                                So the point of the demand access, you dont get it till you need is the key idea for effective
                                resource sharing with data network. The second principal that he uncovered was the idea to use distributed control
                                in network. Noone switch device authority should control the entire network, rather every switch should sharing that control.
                                It should decide the routing procedure, decide how much traffic was allowed in, where it's going, when to do reassembly,
                                when to do all the function in redistributed fashion.

                                In the early 1960s surfing was the search for the perfect wave mail was only delivered by the post office. on the line meant
                                waiting behind someone at the movie theater and the server were a waitress.But the decade were on new ideas were reshaped America
                                for some Civil Rights was the cause, for stopping the Vietnam War, for others it was landing on the moon. But in the worlds of the computer,
                                the new big idea was called timesharing. the old computers had been big machines that you punched cards and then then you
                                submitted the cards in decks and the next day you got the answers.But in 1969 the timesharing was happening where you
                                would actually sit at a terminal and you would type in your questions and programs and the answer would be back 2 seconds later.
                                Among the computer projects that ARPA supported was time-sharing, in which many users could work at terminals to share a single
                                large computer. Users could work interactively instead of using punched cards or punched tape in a batch processing style.
                                Taylor's office in the Pentagon had a terminal connected to time-sharing at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a terminal
                                connected to the Berkeley Timesharing System at the University of California, Berkeley, and a third terminal to the System
                                Development Corporation in Santa Monica, California. He noticed each system developed a community of users, but was isolated from
                                the other communities. Taylor hoped to build a computer network to connect the ARPA-sponsored projects together, if nothing else,
                                to let him communicate to all of them through one terminal.
                                In 1968 also was the year Larry Roberts sought out the engineers to build the advance research project agencies computer network
                                the ARPANET. The Acron that would grow to become the mighty internet,it was going to be based on special purpose
                                mini computer is called interface message processor or imps and revolutionary technology was called packet switching.
                                The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), an arm of the U.S. Defense Department, funded the development of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in the late 1960s.
                                Its initial purpose was to link computers at Pentagon-funded research institutions over telephone lines.
