                            In the early days of the World Wide Web, using the Internet was limited to those who knew
                            how to use it. Being able to surf the World Wide Web with ease was the goal of Mark
                            Andreessen, a University of Illinois Computer Science student. “He imagined a future were
                            everyone including regular people, could use the web as part of our regular lives”. Mark,
                            was the inventor of the first graphical web browser, Mosaic. Within months he had millions
                            of regular people that downloaded his browser and who were using it. When Jim Clark, a very
                            wealthy business man from silicon valley, found out about how many users this browser had,
                            he sent Mark a business opportunity. Mark, being a Junior in college, was astounded from
                            the offer for a full time position and became business partners with Jim Clark under
                            Netscape Communications. The only thing between Jim and Mark and mass fortune were business
                            rivals Microsoft. At the time Microsoft had virtually a monopoly on computer operating
                            systems. Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft and Harvard dropout, were stopping and
                            destroying small tech startups that were trying to overthrow them from their monopoly.
                            When Netscape released their new web browser, Navigator, it got over 1 millions downloads
                            and got the attention of many important people, specifically Bill Gates. The massive amount
                            of downloads that Navigator was getting made him realize that web browsers are the next big
                            thing and Gates would try to destroy anyone from becoming more powerful than him, starting
                            the browser wars. Bill Gates wanting to take the easy victory and offered Netscape
                            Communications 1 millions dollars for their company. However, since Netscape had a well
                            known Anti-trust Lawyer with them, legal actions was to be taken against Microsoft. At
                            some point, Netscape Communication went public and had and IPO. Its IPO went crazy and
                            made the owners of Netscape richer than they already were. At this point the people at
                            Netscape felt invincible and started downplaying Microsoft, the giants in technology at
                            the time.  Microsoft just about had enough from Netscape and released their own internet
                            browser called Internet Explorer. Within a few months, Netscape shares plummeted and soon
                            ceased to exist. However, it wasn’t the end of the war for Microsoft as they now faced the
                            federal US government. Being found guilty of breaking anti trust laws, Gates had to split
                            Microsoft up, but before an appeal was made. Many people saw this as Microsoft getting away
                            with murder but the damage had already been done and Netscape was no more. The ultimate
                            victor of the browser wars- Microsoft.

                            Let’s talk about about the “Browser Wars.”
                            Jim Clark and its renegade band of young web browser pioneers would launch the
                            fastest-growing
                            software company the world had ever seen.Netscape Communications under the watchful eye of
                            Clark
                            were adherent to the cause of spreading the reach of the still embryonic web and hopefully
                            getting rich in the process.
                            Back in Illinois the gang had created the first graphical web browser mosaic. Now they would
                            work like maniacs to build a new browser based on
                            that and turn the internet into the future of Commerce and communication.
                            I think the mission of the group was to take over the world as quickly as possible. Knowing
                            nothing big or really
                            grand they would just go out there and make software so compelling and so great that you'd
                            have to be an idiot not to want it.
                            That was the way Jim expressed things. There lie small goals and to go out there and take
                            over the world and do something that was great. But everyone at
                            Netscape knew that time was of the essence. The web was becoming more popular with every
                            passing day.
                            The fear was that another more powerful company would see its potential and launch a browser
                            before Netscape had a chance to.
                            There was an extreme sense of urgency that once they started it wasn't a hard thing to do.
                            Thomas Riordan at one point contacted the young company to sniff around for
                            information and found that Netscape came off a different public vibe one of supreme
                            arrogance. We were kind of aware of them at a distance and talked to an executive there and
                            basically got
                            told to go pound sand. Microsoft's calling Netscape 15 minutes and just
                            told to not be interested, not just not interested but don't even try calling back when
                            you're at
                            Microsoft. You kind of get used to being
                            kind of Lords of the industry and everybody paying you some an homage at some point in time
                            It's clear that Netscape culturally already perceived Microsoft as the people to take out.
                            On the 13th of
                            October, 1994, after months of feverish non-stop coding, netscape's new web browser
                            navigator finally hit the
                            streets from this moment. Conflict was inevitable with Netscape cast as the upstart. David
                            and Microsoft as the mighty Goliath. Now you might not think that David would have much of a
                            chance in this fight but
                            from the moment Netscape's browser navigator was launched, it was an instant runaway
                            success. When the first release
                            was set up in one of the conference rooms. A computer was setup to watch the downloads. We
                            had a sound effect
                            be a cannon shot every time somebody downloaded the software and you know after a while it
                            sounded like a war
                            . Like a wildfire around the globe, the Internet age had truly begun and it had nothing
                            to do with Microsoft. There's a point probably when Netscape got a million downloads and
                            suddenly we thought what's
                            going on? Million downloads, that's a pretty big number but the truth is the
                            Microsoft's worries about Netscape ran a
                            lot deeper than its little browser and to understand why requires just a little technical
                            understanding in the computer
                            business. The companies that have the most power control, known as a
                            software platform, that's the software on which other programs run on top with this near
                            monopoly over the Windows
                            operating system. Microsoft controlled the ultimate platform. It was the one on which the
                            whole computer business rose
                            and fell and for years it was impossible to imagine that anyone could ever
                            challenge its supremacy. But now Bill Gates as many rivals in Silicon Valley began to
                            imagine a different future. A
                            future where the browser could be an alternative platform, one where you could carry out all
                            your computing needs
                            online thereby leveling the playing field. The industry and rendering Windows, the most
                            profitable software in the history of man. The completely irrelevant Netscape's sudden
                            success was impossible
                            for Microsoft to ignore. Suddenly Bill Gates got the importance of the web but
                            the scale of his own strategic blunder and the need to rectify it right now.
                            Late one night gates added his computer and pounded out a memo to his troops entitled, the
                            internet tidal wave. He declared that the web was quote, the single most important
                            development in
                            computing, since the PC and he wrote about Netscape as quote "a new competitor born on the
                            internet a competitor",that
                            Microsoft absolutely had to quote match and beat. This was a complete take a right turn
                            everybody right now. Starting now, not like next week or you know
                            next month. Bills you know message to the company was let's go find lots of ways for us to
                            to now engage in this new battle. It was absolutely like a
                            sort of everyman/all hands on deck kind of call to action. The beginning of the browser in
                            1993 the internet was unknown and
                            unloved outside a tiny circle of hard core computer hackers and scientists but by 1995 the
                            situation had changed
                            dramatically.

                            The World Wide Web invented in 1989 by an English scientist called Tim Berners-Lee. It's one
                            of those technologies that you
                            don't know you need until you start using it. Now today we're all used to the web with its
                            fancy video and graphics
                            and sound. Where one mouse click is like rolling down a new path. Who knows where you'll end
                            up but back
                            then the web was very different. There were very few precious web pages and they consisted
                            of nothing but line after line
                            of boring text. There was hardly anything worth finding and no way to find it. A visionary
                            University of Illinois computer science student Tim
                            had a crazy idea. He imagined a future or everyone including regular people like you and me
                            would use the web as part of
                            our daily lives. He was working on a different product and then he got wild
                            eyed about this thing called the web. The Internet at that point was really only for
                            nerds.It was really only for
                            academics and researchers and scientists and and there wasn't anything that ordinary people
                            could do on it
                            But it was so useful to the people who were using it that he always figured everybody should
                            be able to use it but
                            he was like "yeah man this stuff is gonna change the world". It'll be great you know. It's
                            global hypermedia
                            and so I was just like yeah okay whatever. Andreessen may have been the most excitable, but
                            soon enough he and a
                            bunch of his college programming pals worked on making the web easier and more intuitive to
                            use. Adding images
                            pictures audio and video capabilities. The fruit of their labors was this: a dead simple
                            piece of point-and-click
                            software. The world's first graphical web browser and every time you surf the Internet today
                            you're using one of its
                            descendants.In the fall of 1993, the Illinois geeks posted mosaic online and made it a
                            freely downloadable gift to
                            humanity, and what a gift it turned out to be. The announcement was first posted on a new
                            script on Usenet
                            newsgroup. At that point, the browser was sent to to 12 people and then it just
                            went viral from there. So it spread from 12 to a hundred to a thousand to
                            ten thousand to a hundred thousand to a million. This was the moment when the internet went
                            from obscurity to ubiquity
                            from a toy for geeks to a tool for scientists.
